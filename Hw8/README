Alex Ong 1.08

   Spawned in Pokemon for PC and trainers. Implemented Trainer battles and Wild Pokemon encounters. Almost all the features of 
1.08 are implemented besides calculating Missed moves and Fleeing battle odds. Inventories have been added to hold revive/healing 
poitions for now. Wild Pokemon can be captured and added to the PC's pokedex (up to 6) once the Wild Pokemon has been defeated!

Not all starting pokemon the PC chooses will have available moves, so restart the game to test out any battle mechanics with the PC's 
pokemon!!
