    Generated the game trainers on the map: hikers, rivals, wanderers, pacers, random walkers, and stationaries. Game uses the 
  flag "--numtrainers" to allow the user to generate as many trainers as they want. Implemented the logic to make all NPCs
  move according to the document specifications.
