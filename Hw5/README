    Created the user interface and unbuffered input to move the PC. Added features to enter Marts / Centers, display a list of trainers,
and started battles if NPC and PC ran into each other. The only element that I wasn't able to complete was the scrolling feature of the 
trainer list. For now I have just have the full list of trainers printed.
