  This assignment adds the Dijkstra algorthm for finding shortest path to every
cell on the map. There is a randomly spawned player character on the road
that acts as the source node. There are two types of NPCs, Rivals and Hikers that
have different weights when moving through terrain types.
  Used instructor's fib heap for priority queue implementation.
